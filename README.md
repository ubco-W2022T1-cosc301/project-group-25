I have been a passionate football fan from a young age. So when I stumbled upon a dataset about statistics of all the footballers in the top 5 leagues in the world, I knew I had to pick this dataset to base my project on! We hope to analyze different football player statistics to compare the performances of the players in each of the leagues. We collectively thought it would be cool to analyze footballers, since there are a lot of unique statistics that people normally do not think of when considering how skillful a football player is. We were curious about finding the answers to a few questions after taking a look at the data. Our topics of interest include, but are not limited to: finding the optimal age of an average football player, analyzing what attribute a player is dominant in given their position on the field and comparing footballers between each of the top 5 leagues.

This data was provided by the Premier League, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Serie A and La Liga. The dataset contains football player stats per 90 minutes. The data includes stats like rank, position, squad name, age, goals, shots on target, goals per shot, yellow cards, red cards, offsides, etc… This data was collected for the 2021-2022 football season. The purpose of this dataset is for fun! This dataset was created thanks to public player stat records, the author of this dataset acknowledges: https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/stats/players/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats as the source of all these player statistics. This player stat data is assembled through a combination of live data collected by a team covering each match, as well as through tracking perimeter cameras that track the ball’s location as well as players’ positions. We speculate that we will be able to pull some interesting discoveries about football players by comparing these statistics.
