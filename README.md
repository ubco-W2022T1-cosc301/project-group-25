## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I have been a passionate football fan from a young age. So, when I stumbled upon a dataset about statistics of all the footballers in the top 5 leagues in the world, I knew I had to pick this dataset to base my project on. We hope to analyze different football players' statistics to compare the performances of the players in each of the leagues. We collectively thought it would be cool to analyze footballers, since there are a lot of unique statistics that people normally do not think of when considering how skillful a football player is. Our topics of interest include but are not limited to finding the optimal age of an average football player, analyzing what attribute a player is dominant in given their position on the field and comparing footballers between each of the top 5 leagues. We have chosen these topics as we are curious to take a deep dive into the statistics of the players. We want to find out any interesting trends or discoveries in these stats that we normally don't notice when we are just watching the matches for fun.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data was provided by the Premier League, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Serie A and La Liga. It was created thanks to the public player stats records; the author of this dataset acknowledges as the source of all these player statistics. The dataset contains football player stats per 90 minutes, during the 2021-2022 football season. The data includes stats like a player's position, squad name, age, goals, shots on target, goals per shot, expected goals, pass accuracy, successful tackles, shot accuracy, etc. The purpose of this dataset is to help the people associated with the beautiful game- whether you're in the media, gambling industry, work for a club, or are a fan, this data has everyone covered. The data has been assembled through a combination of live data collected by analysts covering each match, with the aid of tracking perimeter cameras that track the ball’s location as well as the players’ positions and movements. We speculate that we will be able to pull some interesting discoveries about football players by comparing these statistics.
